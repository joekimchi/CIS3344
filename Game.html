        <h1>Celebrity Game Javascript Instructions</h1>
        <p>Create the Game.html HTML page that implements the game using JavaScript.

        <p>a. The page must contain an image, a textbox, and a button to submit their guess.
        <p>i. The image will change as the user progresses through the game.

        <p>
            b. Use JavaScript to implement the game and the interactive behavior of the page.
        <p>
            i. You will need at least 30 images of celebrities, which should be stored in an
            images folder.

        <p>
            ii.Create an array to store JavaScript objects that represent a celebrity. The
            JavaScript celebrity object will contain the name of the celebrity, the celebrity’s
            birthdate, and the URL for the celebrity’s image file.

        <p>
            iii. The game involves 10 rounds where each round is worth 10 points and a final
            round where the user can wager the points they earned.
        <p>
            iv. Each round involves using JavaScript to randomly choose a celebrity object from
            the array, display the celebrity’s image using the information stored in the
            celebrity object, allow the user to guess person’s name, and score their answer.
            Once a celebrity is chosen from the array, it should be removed from the array
            and not selected again.
        <p>
            v. After the first 10 rounds of the game, the game should display the user’s score
            and allow them to wager the points they earned on one final question. The final
            question will display a celebrity, but the user must now guess how old they are
            and be within 2 years of their age. You must use JavaScript to calculate the
            celebrity’s age based on their birthdate. If the user is correct, you will add the
            points they wagered to their total; otherwise, you will subtract the wagered
            points from their total.

        <p>
            c. Display a message when the game ends that contains the user’s score and allow them to
            play the game again.
        <p>
            3. Also, you need to use CSS to style the page and make it look professional and attractive.
        <p>
            4. Remember to add a section to the labs.html page created in Lab 1 for this lab.
        <p>
            a. Include a description of what you learned, what elements you liked/disliked, and a link
            to the page you created for Lab 3.
