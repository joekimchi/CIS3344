	    <!--Lab 1-->
            <h2 align="center">Lab 1: HTML & CSS Home Page</h2>
            <p> <strong>a) Describe your level of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any other client-side frameworks.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Coming into this class, I had very limited expierence with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used to do some Inspect-Element back
                in my YouTube days to change the amount of subscribers I had to screenshot and troll my friends...only to realize that it goes
                back to the actual amount after refreshing the page. I also did a lot of HTML over the summer, using tutorials online.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>b) Describe what advanced CSS techniques you employed in your style sheet.</strong></p>
            <p>
                For the body background, as well as header and footer, I used a color palette to determine colors that will look great together
                to make the site as asthetically pleasing as possible. I also used the floating technique to have the navigation bar "float" over
                the page when scrolling down.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>c) What did I like about this lab and what did I dislike?</strong></p>
            <p>
                I really dislike the amount of new Syntax that I had to memorize - I still reference public sources in order to write HTML.
                I really liked how we were able to customize our site using CSS and implement it into HTML.
            </p>

	    <!--Lab 2-->
            <h2 align="center">Lab 2: Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p>
            <p><strong>Include a description of what you learned, what elements you liked/disliked, and a link to the page you created for Lab 2.</strong></p>
            <p>
            This was extremely difficult especially because we were never taught how to implement such responsive features
            so a lot of Google was used. However, I did learn a lot MYSELF even though nothing like this was really demo'd
            besides the one Eagles website. It would've been easier to see what goes into a responsive website such as
            sample CSS and sample HTML. Or at least the foundation of it. 
            </p>

	    <p>
            Learning the different functions such as the one that can be used for the navigation bar when being collapsed was very useful 
            and an interesting one to learn.
