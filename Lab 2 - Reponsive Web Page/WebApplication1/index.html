        <p><i>Win #80 was a special one.... </i></p>
        <p>A comeback not even Tiger Woods saw coming a year ago. </p>

        <p>A chaotic celebration that golf hasn't seen even in the best of times. </p>

        <p>
            Woods delivered the perfect ending to his amazing return from four back surgeries on Sunday with a
            performance that felt like the old days. He left the competition feeling hopeless as he built a five-shot
            lead early and hung on to win the Tour Championship.
        </p>

        <p>
            Woods raised both arms over his head after he tapped in for par and a 1-over 71 for a two-shot victory over
            Billy Horschel, the 80th victory of his PGA Tour career and his first in more than five years.
        </p>

        <p>"It was a grind out there," Woods said. "I loved every bit of it."</p>

        <p>
            It felt like a coronation coming down the 18th green after he hit his second shot to the par 5 safely in a
            bunker in front of the green. The crowd came through the ropes and walked behind him, just like that walk from the
            left side of the 18th fairway when he won the Masters in 1997, and when the enormous gallery of Chicago followed after
            him when he won the Western Open that summer.

        </p>

        <p><i>Last win was in 2013</i></p>

                    <b>Win No. 79</b> - Tiger Woods made history yet again at Firestone Country Club with a seven-shot triumph at
                    the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational. Woods all but locked up the No. 1 position in the
                    upcoming FedExCup Playoffs with his dominating win that featured a tournament-record tying 61 -- that could
                    easily have been a 59 -- in Round 2. Woods took a seven-shot lead into the weekend and never let anyone get close
                    as he secured his eighth title in this event. That matches the TOUR record for wins in an event held by Sam Snead
                    (Greater Greensboro Open) and Woods himself (Arnold Palmer Invitational). The title marked Woods' fifth TOUR victory
                    of the 2013 season and his 18th in 42 World Golf Championships starts.

                    <b>Win No. 78</b> - Woods left TPC Sawgrass late on Mother's Day night with his fourth win of the season and the
                    78th Tour title of his career, just four shy of Sam Snead's all-time record of 82. He has won seven of his last 21 stroke-play
                    Tour events and is now 52-4 when holding at least a share of the lead entering the final round. Woods also became the sixth
                    player to win multiple Players titles in the tournament's 40 years, joining Hal Sutton, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington,
                    Davis Love III and Jack Nicklaus, the only three-time winner.

                    <b>Win No. 77</b> - Tiger Woods shot a final-round 70 at Bay Hill Country Club Monday, holding off Justin Rose to win the Arnold
                    Palmer Invitational for the eighth time. With the win, Woods moved into the No. 1 position in the World Golf Rankings. It's the
                    first time since October 2010 that Woods has been on top of the golf world. Woods finished the tournament 13-under par, two strokes
                    better than Rose. He made his biggest move Saturday, when he shot a 6-under 66 to take the lead. Woods bogeyed three of the final
                    11 holes on Monday, but five birdies allowed him to hold onto his advantage. Rose finished the final round with four birdies and two bogeys.
