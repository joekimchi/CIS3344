            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> is an American multinational technology company headquartered
            in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.
            The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod
            portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker.
            Apple's software includes the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife
            and iWork creativity and productivity suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Xcode.
            Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
            computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, saw
            significant momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer
            designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped
            new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing
            commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited
            software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between executives at the company. In 1985, Wozniak stepped away from
            Apple and Jobs resigned entirely, bringing other Apple employees with him and creating his own company that same year—NeXT.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from
            competitors, in particular, those offered with the Microsoft Windows operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at
            Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy NeXT to bring Jobs back. Jobs regained leadership within the company
            and became the new CEO shortly after. He began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail
            stores in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changing some
            of the hardware used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that
            Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics. He also announced the
            iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health
            complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company.

            Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $229 billion for the 2017 fiscal year. Apple is the world's largest information
            technology company by revenue and the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung and Huawei. In August 2018,
            Apple became the first public U.S. company to be valued at over US$1 trillion. The company employs 123,000 full-time employees
            and maintains 504 retail stores in 24 countries as of 2018. It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music
            retailer. As of January 2018, more than 1.3 billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide. The company enjoys a high level
            of brand loyalty and has been repeatedly ranked as the world's most valuable brand. However, it receives significant criticism
            regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental and business practices, including anti-competitive behavior,
            as well as the origins of source materials.

    <!-- LABS -->
    <div class="content" id="labs">
        <h1 align="center">Labs</h1>
        <h2 align="center">Lab 1: HTML & CSS Home Page</h2>
        <p> <strong>a) Describe your level of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any other client-side frameworks.</strong></p>

        <p>
            Coming into this class, I had very limited expierence with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used to do some Inspect-Element back
            in my YouTube days to change the amount of subscribers I had to screenshot and troll my friends...only to realize that it goes
            back to the actual amount after refreshing the page. I also did a lot of HTML over the summer, using tutorials online.
        </p>

        <p> <strong>b) Describe what advanced CSS techniques you employed in your style sheet.</strong></p>
        <p>
            For the body background, as well as header and footer, I used a color palette to determine colors that will look great together
            to make the site as asthetically pleasing as possible. I also used the floating technique to have the navigation bar "float" over
            the page when scrolling down.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>c) What did I like about this lab and what did I dislike?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I really dislike the amount of new Syntax that I had to memorize - I still reference public sources in order to write HTML.
            I really liked how we were able to customize our site using CSS and implement it into HTML.
        </p>

        <!--Lab 2-->
        <h2 align="center">Lab 2: Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>
        <p><strong>Include a description of what you learned, what elements you liked/disliked, and a link to the page you created for Lab 2.</strong></p>
        <p>
            This was extremely difficult especially because we were never taught how to implement such responsive features
            so a lot of Google was used. However, I did learn a lot MYSELF even though nothing like this was really demo'd
            besides the one Eagles website. It would've been easier to see what goes into a responsive website such as
            sample CSS and sample HTML. Or at least the foundation of it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning the different functions such as the one that can be used for the navigation bar when being collapsed was very useful 
            and an interesting one to learn.
