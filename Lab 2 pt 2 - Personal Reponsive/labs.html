            <p> <strong>a) Describe your level of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any other client-side frameworks.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Coming into this class, I had very limited expierence with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used to do some Inspect-Element back
                in my YouTube days to change the amount of subscribers I had to screenshot and troll my friends...only to realize that it goes
                back to the actual amount after refreshing the page. I also did a lot of HTML over the summer, using tutorials online.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>b) Describe what advanced CSS techniques you employed in your style sheet.</strong></p>
            <p>
                For the body background, as well as header and footer, I used a color palette to determine colors that will look great together
                to make the site as asthetically pleasing as possible. I also used the floating technique to have the navigation bar "float" over
                the page when scrolling down.
            </p>
            <p> <strong>c) What did I like about this lab and what did I dislike?</strong></p>
            <p>
                I really dislike the amount of new Syntax that I had to memorize - I still reference public sources in order to write HTML.
                I really liked how we were able to customize our site using CSS and implement it into HTML.
